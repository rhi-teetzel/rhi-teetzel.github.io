        <h2>ABOUT</h2>    
        <p>
    Hi, I'm Rhianna. I graduated in the spring of 2020 from a Software Development 14-week program at We Can Code IT, located in Cleveland, Ohio. I have always been passionate about technology and learning how to make things work. Here is a little backstory to give you a better idea of what I am all about!
    </br></br>
    I grew up playing on my dad's computer, which was initially a <em>Windows 3.1, </em>and it really was the little engine that could... I learned at a very young age to use DOS to open and execute my favorite games. That is when my passion for computers was born! I continued on that path for most of my childhood and teenage years, always tinkering with files, downloading mods and making things my own (sorry, dad!). It wasn't until my mid-twenties that the light bulb went off, and I made the decision to officially pursue something I've always truly loved. 
    </br>
    Professionally, I have years of customer service experience- ranging from managing a laser tag facility, to front desk reception at a veterinary clinic, and all the way down to Orlando where I operated attractions at Walt Disney World! 
    </br>
    After some time in college to originally pursue Graphic Design, and one Associate of Art degree later, I have finally pinpointed what I love most: </br>
    Using technology to CREATE!</br></br>
     Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, or even just to share stories-- I'd love to chat!
