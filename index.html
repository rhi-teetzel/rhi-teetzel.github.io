        <h2>ABOUT</h2>    
        <p>
    Hi, I'm Rhianna. I am here because I've been given the amazing opportunity to be a student at <em>We Can Code It</em> in Cleveland, Ohio. This is my first dive into the world of coding and I couldn't be more excited! 
    <br>
    I grew up playing on my dad's computer, which was a <strong>Windows 3.1 </strong>and it ran just about as well as you're thinking it did.. I learned at a very young age use DOS to open and execute my favorite PC games. I was always very comfortable behind a computer, and I felt like I understood the language it spoke. 
    <br>
    Professionally, I have a long history of customer service, with my experiences ranging from managing a laser tag facility, to front desk at a veterinary clinic, and even all the way to Florida to operate coasters at Walt Disney World! 
    <br>After a few years in college to originally pursue Graphic Design, I have finally found what I love most: Using technology to CREATE!
    <br>
     If you are intrigued by anything I've mentioned so far, please reach out-- I'd love to chat!
